**Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):** 

ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to easily run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster.

**Example:** You can use ECS to deploy a microservices architecture by containerizing different components of your application. ECS can manage the deployment, scaling, and orchestration of these containers.
