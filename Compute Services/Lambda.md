**AWS Lambda:** 

Lambda is a serverless computing service. It enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You upload your code, and Lambda automatically takes care of scaling and executing it in response to triggers, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or updates to a DynamoDB table.

**Example:** You can use Lambda to automatically resize images stored in an S3 bucket whenever a new image is uploaded. Lambda will execute the resizing code without the need for you to manage any servers.
