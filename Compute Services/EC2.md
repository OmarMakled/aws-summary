**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** 

Virtual servers in the cloud.

**EC2 vs. Lambda:** EC2 provides virtual servers, while Lambda is a serverless compute service where you only pay for the compute time used.


**Example:** You can launch an EC2 instance to host a website. If your website experiences increased traffic, you can easily add more instances to handle the load, and scale them down during periods of low demand.
