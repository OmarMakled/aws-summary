*   User and access management.
*   Key difference: Controls access to AWS resources with granular permissions.

**IAM vs. Cognito:** IAM manages access to AWS services, Cognito provides user identity for apps.

**IAM vs. WAF:** IAM is for user access management, while WAF is a web application firewall.
