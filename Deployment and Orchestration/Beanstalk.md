**AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** 

Platform as a Service (PaaS) for deploying applications.


**Description:** Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of applications. It abstracts away infrastructure details and allows you to focus on your code. It supports multiple programming languages, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and more.

**Example:** Suppose you have a web application written in Node.js. With Elastic Beanstalk, you can simply upload your Node.js application code, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, load balancing, auto-scaling, and other infrastructure aspects. You don't need to worry about provisioning servers or managing the underlying infrastructure.
